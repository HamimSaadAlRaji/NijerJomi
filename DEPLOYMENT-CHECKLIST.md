# üöÄ Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Process

### Automated Checks

Run the automated pre-deployment script:

```bash
npm run pre-deploy
```

This script will automatically check:

- ‚úÖ Production build success
- ‚úÖ Environment configuration
- ‚úÖ Bundle size analysis
- ‚úÖ Critical files existence
- ‚úÖ Package.json validation
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation
- ‚úÖ Code quality (linting)

### Manual Verification Steps

#### 1. **Functional Testing**

- [ ] Test all major user flows
- [ ] Verify wallet connection works
- [ ] Test property registration and transfer
- [ ] Check admin dashboard functionality
- [ ] Verify marketplace features
- [ ] Test user verification process

#### 2. **Cross-Browser Testing**

- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (if targeting Mac users)
- [ ] Edge (if targeting Windows users)

#### 3. **Responsive Design**

- [ ] Mobile (320px - 768px)
- [ ] Tablet (768px - 1024px)
- [ ] Desktop (1024px+)

#### 4. **Performance Testing**

```bash
# Build and preview locally
npm run deploy-check
```

- [ ] Page load times < 3 seconds
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 80
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] No 404 errors for assets

#### 5. **Security Review**

- [ ] No sensitive data in console logs
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] API endpoints secured
- [ ] Wallet integration follows best practices

#### 6. **Content Review**

- [ ] All text is correct and typo-free
- [ ] Images are optimized and loading
- [ ] Links are working correctly
- [ ] Meta tags are set properly

#### 7. **Blockchain Integration**

- [ ] Smart contract addresses are correct for target network
- [ ] ABI files are up to date
- [ ] Gas estimation is reasonable
- [ ] Error handling for failed transactions

### Environment-Specific Checks

#### Development ‚Üí Staging

- [ ] Update API endpoints to staging
- [ ] Use testnet contract addresses
- [ ] Enable debug features if needed

#### Staging ‚Üí Production

- [ ] Update API endpoints to production
- [ ] Use mainnet contract addresses
- [ ] Disable debug features
- [ ] Update analytics tracking IDs
- [ ] Configure error reporting (Sentry, etc.)

### Post-Deployment Verification

#### Immediate (0-5 minutes)

- [ ] Site loads correctly
- [ ] No 500 errors in server logs
- [ ] Critical user flows work
- [ ] Wallet connection successful

#### Short-term (5-30 minutes)

- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Verify analytics tracking
- [ ] Test from different locations/networks

#### Long-term (1+ hours)

- [ ] Monitor user feedback
- [ ] Check transaction success rates
- [ ] Review performance over time
- [ ] Monitor resource usage

### Emergency Rollback Plan

1. Keep previous version artifacts available
2. Document rollback procedure
3. Have monitoring alerts set up
4. Prepare communication plan for users

### Tools & Commands

#### Local Testing

```bash
# Run full pre-deployment check
npm run pre-deploy

# Build and preview locally
npm run deploy-check

# Check bundle analysis
npx vite-bundle-analyzer dist

# Lighthouse audit
npx lighthouse http://localhost:4173 --view
```

#### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Bundle size analysis
npm run build && ls -la dist/assets/

# Check for unused dependencies
npx depcheck

# Security audit
npm audit
```
